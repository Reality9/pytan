# This is the Tanium Question Data Bro script which is a requirement for Tanium
# data to be sent to a Bro instance via the Broker API.
#
# This requires that Bro be configured with Broker support. Compiling Broker
# itself is a prerequisite. instructions on compiling Broker are here:
#       https://github.com/bro/broker
# Pay particular attention to the prerequisites for compling Broker, and do not
# forget to clone the Bro cmake submodule in the Broker source directory. To do
# this, run
#       git clone https://github.com/bro/cmake
# in the root of the Broker source directory, such that a cmake directory is
# created and filled.
#
# Broker should be compiled on the Bro machine that listens for connections,
# and it is recommended that the Tanium Bro integration python scripts also
# run from.
#
# This Bro script should be placed in your <Bro dir>/share/bro/site directory.
# Once Bro is restarted, netstat should show that Broker is listening for
# connections on the port specified in the file.
#
# If a field is typically modified, a comment # Modify appears either before or
# in-line.
#
# Critically, it is important that each bro script be modified to match the
# pytan_bro.ini file questions. This means knowing the counts of columns
# and names of columns coming from Tanium.
